Leaf Disease Detection Using CNN

A deep learning–based system that detects plant leaf diseases using image classification.
The model analyzes leaf images and predicts whether the leaf is healthy or affected by a disease.

##  Features

- Image-based plant disease detection
- CNN-based classification model
- Supports multiple leaf disease categories
- Separate scripts for training, evaluation, and prediction
- Clean and modular Python code

## Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
